The New Play Exchange is a script discovery and recommendation engine for the new play sector. I worked on the New Play Exchange as a developer and candidate worker-owner at Quilted.

In this project, I implemented subscription-based payment processing using the **Stripe** API. We integrated payment into the new user sign-up workflow and gave users the ability to manage their subscriptions.

This project was built in **Drupal** and **PHP**, along with **JavaScript** on the front end.
