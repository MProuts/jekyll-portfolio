I'm a full-stack web developer living the SF Bay Area. I work at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Outside of software, I like cooking, dancing, riding my bike, and reading. I also like learning about new ways to get involved with the movements I care about. A great way to get a sense of my interests is to check out my <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> page.

Community is really important to me. In my free time, I like sharing meals and catching up with my roommates and close friends.
